# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and implementation of a stock price prediction model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) adept at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them particularly effective for time series forecasting tasks such as stock price prediction.

## Project Overview

Predicting stock prices is a complex challenge due to the volatile and stochastic nature of financial markets. This project aims to leverage the capabilities of LSTM networks to model and forecast stock prices by learning from historical data. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and visualization of the predicted versus actual stock prices.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preparing historical stock price data for modeling.
- **Model Architecture**: Building and training an LSTM network tailored for stock price prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plotting actual versus predicted stock prices to visualize the model's accuracy.
